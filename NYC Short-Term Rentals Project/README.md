# NYC Short-Term Rentals Project

## Background

This is a Masterschool project that takes a look at the short-term rentals situation in New York City to provide data insights for a real-estate start-up. It involves taking in Airbnb data, cleaning it, and analyzing it. The idea is to uncover key trends in popular neighborhoods, rental prices, property types, length of stay, and demand over time. The insights gained from this analysis has the potential to provide valuable information to the start-up on how to make informed business decisions.

## NYC Rentals Python Cleaning

This is the data cleaning portion of the project and it utilizes Python instead of Excel. There are three files that are imported and they are cleaned individually before being joined together on a shared column.
* The first file that is uploaded is "prices" and it is a CSV file. It has three columns: listing id(listing_id), the price of the listing per day(prices), and the full name of the neighborhood of the listing(nbhood_full).
