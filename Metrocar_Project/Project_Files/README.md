# Metrocar Project

## Background

This is a Masterschool project that deals with a funnel analysis. In this case, it is a customer funnel analysis that shows the dropoff rate of indiviuals at each level of the funnel. Using this information we can make recommendations to our stakeholders about which stages of the funnel would be a good idea to put their time and money. In addition to the code for the funnel analysis, I've created a visual representation of said funnel in Tableau. PUT LINK HERE. I've also got a list of ten queries that give various insights into the dataset.
