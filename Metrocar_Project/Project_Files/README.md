# Metrocar Project

## Background

This is a Masterschool project that runs you through a funnel analysis. In this case, it is a customer funnel analysis that shows the dropoff rate of indiviuals at each level of the funnel. In addition to the code for the funnel analysis, I've created a visual representation of the funnel in Tableau. PUT LINK HERE. I've also got a list of ten queries that give various insights into the dataset.
